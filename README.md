# Traffic-Light-Controller
This project implements a traffic signal controller using Verilog, simulates the design using Icarus Verilog, and visualizes the simulation results using GTKWave. The controller manages traffic lights for a highway and a country road.

Project Components:

Verilog Design: The sig_control module is the main traffic signal controller designed in Verilog.
Testbench: The stimulus module is used to apply test stimuli to the sig_control module and generate a VCD file for waveform analysis.
Simulation: Icarus Verilog is used to compile and run the simulation.
Visualization: GTKWave is used to view and analyze the waveform generated from the simulation.

Files:

TrafficSignalControl.v - The Verilog code for the traffic signal controller.
TrafficTestBench.v - The Verilog testbench to generate the VCD file.
traffic_light_controller.vcd - The waveform dump file generated by the simulation.
Prerequisites
Icarus Verilog: For compiling and simulating Verilog designs.
GTKWave: For viewing the waveform dump files.
